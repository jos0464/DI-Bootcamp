suggestions for improvement:
- The code submission is for a 'Circle' class, which is completely unrelated to the exercises and topics covered in the provided chapter content (Dunder methods for a Currency class, Modules, string, datetime and faker modules).
- The code should address the specific instructions of the Currency class, importing modules, string manipulation, date/time calculations, and faker module usage.

suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2 is missing; the provided code does not include the creation of `func.py` or the import statement in `exercise_one.py` as requested by the instructions.
- Consider adding input validation or error handling for Exercise 6, specifically for the `minutes_lived` function, to ensure the birthdate string is in the expected format.  This enhances robustness.
