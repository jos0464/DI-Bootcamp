suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for file operations, such as handling permission errors.
- For `remove_stop_words`, consider reading stop words from a file for better maintainability and scalability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements outlined in the chapter content, including the `Text` class with methods for word frequency, most common word, unique words, and the `from_file` class method. It also correctly implements the `TextModification` class with methods for removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters. The code's functionality directly corresponds to the chapter's instructions.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to read. The use of comments to delineate different sections enhances readability. Minor improvements could include adding docstrings to methods for clarity.
- performance: The code's performance is generally good for the given tasks. Using `Counter` for `most_common_word` is efficient. For larger texts, consider more optimized string manipulation techniques. Reading stop words from a file initially would make the `remove_stop_words` function more performant if used repeatedly.
- security: The code includes basic error handling (e.g., for file not found), which enhances security. Using `encoding='utf-8'` when opening files is also a good practice to avoid encoding issues. However, it would benefit from input sanitization to prevent code injection or other vulnerabilities if the text source is untrusted.
