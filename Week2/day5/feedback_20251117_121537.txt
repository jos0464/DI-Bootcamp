suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code implements an AnagramChecker class, which is completely unrelated to the chapter's content on OOP concepts, data structures (lists), and random number generation for creating a deck of cards.
- The code does not address the exercises outlined in the chapter, specifically creating Card and Deck classes with shuffle and deal methods.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is completely unrelated to the chapter's content. It's an anagram checker, not a deck of cards or an illustration of OOP principles, data structures, or random number generation as requested.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code implements a Rock Paper Scissors game, which, while using some of the listed concepts (OOP, Random Number Generation), does not address the core problem of creating a `Deck` and `Card` class as described in Exercise 2. It also doesn't use Lists as a data structure as specifically requested. Exercise 1 asks about OOP concepts, which is related to the code.
- The code could be improved by directly addressing the `Deck` and `Card` class creation problem. This would involve creating these classes, implementing the shuffle and deal methods, and using lists to store the cards.
