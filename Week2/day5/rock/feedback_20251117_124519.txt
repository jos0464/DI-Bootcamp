suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the logic in `get_game_result` for better readability.
- The code could benefit from some refactoring to avoid long lines in the `get_game_result` method. You could create a helper function or use a dictionary to define the winning conditions.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using an enum or constants for menu choices instead of hardcoded strings ('1', '2', '3') to improve readability and maintainability.
- Add input validation to ensure `results` dictionary has 'win', 'loss', and 'draw' keys before attempting to print. While the current implementation initializes it correctly, unexpected inputs could cause errors.
