suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for file handling, such as try-except blocks, to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions.
- For larger word lists, consider using a dictionary with character counts as keys for `is_anagram`, which could improve performance.
- The docstrings are in French, while the rest of the code is in English; choose one language for consistency.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and easy to understand.
- The code addresses a card game scenario rather than the Anagram Checker requirements. The task requires the creation of two python files - anagram_checker.py and anagrams.py, with specific methods in the AnagramChecker class. This is completely missing in the submitted code.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling, such as handling file not found exceptions when the AnagramChecker class initializes.
- The main function can be further modularized for better readability and maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, which is completely unrelated to the anagram checker project described in the chapter content.
- The chapter content focuses on OOP (Classes, Methods), File I/O (Reading Files), String Manipulation, Algorithm Design (Anagram Checking), User Input and Validation, Conditional Logic, and Loops. This code does not address the core topic of anagram checking.
- The entire structure of the submission, focusing on a different game, makes it impossible to adapt to the task at hand.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is just a list of words and does not implement any of the required functionality (AnagramChecker class, methods, UI in anagrams.py).
- The provided words are not part of a functional program that can check for anagrams or validate user input as specified in the instructions.
